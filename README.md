### Series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

### Linear regression on each relationship:

Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

### Actions

Randomly select at least 500 unique (non-repeat) cities based on latitude and longitude.
Perform a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls.
Include a print log of each city as it's being processed with the city number and city name.
Save a CSV of all retrieved data and a PNG image for each scatter plot.
